~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ THE BULLSHIT FILE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                documenting weird things SEGA Dreamcast games
		somehow manage to get away with doing


Guilty Gear X:
    * attempts to read a 4 byte integer from 0xfffffffc
    * This happens because it reads from -4 offset from a NULL pointer
    * the pointer is 160 bytes from the beginning of some struct which is
      itself 192 bytes
    * there are several such structures in an array
    * this is not always an error sometimes the pointer is not NULL, and instead
      points to a valid memory address
    * on real hardware, *(uint32_t*)0xfffffffc == 0
    * Here is where the NULL pointer is loaded into R4:
          0x8c0245f8:  mov.l   @(r0,r14),r4
    * Here is where the memory access at 0xfffffffc happens:
          0x8c025ece:	add    #-8,r4
          0x8c025ed0:	mov.l  @(4,r4),r3

Street Fighter Alpha 3:
    * needs realistic AICA DMA timings or else it will hang before displaying
      the CAPCOM logo
    * It briefly displays an "ERROR: load failed" message onscreen between the
      two CAPCOM logos despite successfully loading.  This is actually something
      that happens on real hardware and not an emulation bug.

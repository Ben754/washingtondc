~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ THE BULLSHIT FILE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                documenting weird things SEGA Dreamcast games
		somehow manage to get away with doing


Guilty Gear X:
    * attempts to read a 4 byte integer from 0xfffffffc
    * This happens because it reads from -4 offset from a NULL pointer
    * the pointer is 160 bytes from the beginning of some struct which is
      itself 192 bytes
    * there are several such structures in an array
    * this is not always an error sometimes the pointer is not NULL, and instead
      points to a valid memory address
    * on real hardware, *(uint32_t*)0xfffffffc == 0
    * Here is where the NULL pointer is loaded into R4:
          0x8c0245f8:  mov.l   @(r0,r14),r4
    * Here is where the memory access at 0xfffffffc happens:
          0x8c025ece:	add    #-8,r4
          0x8c025ed0:	mov.l  @(4,r4),r3

Street Fighter Alpha 3:
    * needs realistic AICA DMA timings or else it will hang before displaying
      the CAPCOM logo
    * In WashingtonDC's case it displays an error message at the initial
      loading screen but continues to load and run successfully anyways; the
      cause of this is not yet known.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UNKNOWN/UNDER INVESTIGATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zero Gunner 2:
    * Currently hangs at the loading screen just after highlighting the letter L
    * root-cause appears to be related to the game's polling of the GDLEND
      register; this register is supposed to count up the number of bytes
      successfully DMA'd from the GD-ROM.  Game is polling it and will attempt
      to do other things in the background (such as MMU configuration) if it
      increments gradually.

     * the other 0.001% of the time it comes from the bootrom.  This function
     * used to speed things up by explicitly checking the address to see if
     * it's in memory, and if so it would read directly from memory instead of
     * wasting time parsing through the memory map.
     *
     * In the interests of portability and modularity, I had to take out that
     * optimization because SH4 doesn't have a memory pointer, just a
     * memory-map pointer.  This only impacts performance on the interpreter, on
     * the dynarec performance impact is either negligible or nonexistant.

     * optimization, but I don't understand why.  It shouldn't have had a
     * positive impact at all, I was expecting either a negligibly small
     * negative impact or no impact at all.  I can't explain that but I guess

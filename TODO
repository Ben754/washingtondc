This file is mostly for things which need to be done eventually but are
subtle enough to be forgotten.  There are many more things I need to do which
are not recorded here.

* MMU support for Store Queues
* Store queue timing (Is it really supposed to be instant?)
* Unit test for store queues
* CPU Dual Issue pipeline (sometimes the CPU can execute two instructions at
  once.  The current implementation does not model this).  See section 8.2 of
  the sh4 software manual, "Parallel-Executability"
* It might also be a good idea to do a better job counting cycles in general.
  The current implementation assumes that the number of cycles to execute
  each instruction will always be equal to the issue for that instruction.
  There is no emulation of stalls/latency/interdependency.
